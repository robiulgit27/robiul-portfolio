        <p>Hi, my name is Robiul and I began using Wordpress when it first began. I've spent most of my waking hours for the last one years designing, programming and operating Web sites. One of my specialties is taking an idea from scratch and creating a full-fledged platform. I go beyond to produce sites with a unique, outstanding, contemporary look-and-feel. With extensive knowledge of web mechanics, I'm able to optimize complex integrations to require little-to-no maintenance while running on their own for years.</p>

            <p>I am a PHP programmer at heart and create features that are best suited for the job at hand, as opposed to trying to fit a job into features that I can find in pre-existing themes and plugins. I'm also attuned to performance issues and do a lot of repurposing of plugins.</p>
